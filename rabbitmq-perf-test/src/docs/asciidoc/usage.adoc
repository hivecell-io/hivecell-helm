== Basic Usage

The most basic way of running PerfTest only specifies a URI to
connect to, a number of publishers to use (say, 1) and a
number of consumers to use (say, 2). Note that RabbitMQ Java
client can achieve high rates for publishing (up to 80 to 90K
messages per second per connection), given enough bandwidth and when some safety
measures (publisher confirms) are disabled, so overprovisioning
publishers is rarely necessary (unless that's a specific objective of the test).

The following command runs PerfTest with a single publisher
without publisher confirms, two consumers (each receiving a
copy of every message) that use automatic acknowledgement mode
and a single queue named “throughput-test-x1-y2”. Publishers
will publish as quickly as possible, without any rate
limiting. Results will be prefixed with “test1” for easier
identification and comparison:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest -x 1 -y 2 -u "throughput-test-1" -a --id "test 1"

This modification will use 2 publishers and 4 consumers,
typically yielding higher throughput given enough CPU cores
on the machine and RabbitMQ nodes:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest -x 2 -y 4 -u "throughput-test-2" -a --id "test 2"

This modification switches consumers to manual acknowledgements:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest -x 1 -y 2 -u "throughput-test-3" --id "test 3"

This modification changes message size from default (12 bytes) to 4 kB:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest -x 1 -y 2 -u "throughput-test-4" --id "test 4" -s 4000

PerfTest can use durable queues and persistent messages:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest -x 1 -y 2 -u "throughput-test-5" --id "test-5" -f persistent

When PerfTest is running, it is important to monitor various
publisher and consumer metrics provided by the https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html[management UI].
For example, it is possible to see how much network
bandwidth a publisher has been using recently on the
connection page.

Queue page demonstrates message rates, consumer count,
acknowledgement mode used by the consumers, consumer
utilisation and message location break down (disk, RAM,
paged out transient messages, etc). When durable queues and
persistent messages are used, node I/O and message
store/queue index operation metrics become particularly
important to monitor.

Consumers can ack multiple messages at once, for example, 100 in this configuration:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest -x 1 -y 2 -u "throughput-test-6" --id "test-6" \
   -f persistent --multi-ack-every 100


https://www.rabbitmq.com/confirms.html[Consumer prefetch (QoS)] can be configured as well
(in this example to 500):

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest -x 1 -y 2 -u "throughput-test-7" --id "test-7" \
   -f persistent --multi-ack-every 200 -q 500

Publisher confirms can be used with a maximum of N outstanding publishes:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest -x 1 -y 2 -u "throughput-test-8" --id "test-8" \
   -f persistent -q 500 -c 500

PerfTest can publish only a certain number of messages instead of running until shut down:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest -x 1 -y 2 -u "throughput-test-10" --id "test-10" \
   -f persistent -q 500 -pmessages 100000

Publisher rate can be limited:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest -x 1 -y 2 -u "throughput-test-11" --id "test-11" \
   -f persistent -q 500 --rate 5000

Consumer rate can be limited as well to simulate slower consumers or create a backlog:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest -x 1 -y 2 -u "throughput-test-12" --id "test-12" \
   -f persistent --rate 5000 --consumer-rate 2000

Note that the consumer rate limit is applied per consumer, so in the
configuration above the limit is actually 2 * 2000 = 4000
deliveries/second.

PerfTest can be configured to run for a limited amount of time in seconds with the
`-z` option:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest -x 1 -y 2 -u "throughput-test-13" --id "test-13" \
   -f persistent -z 30

Running PerfTest without consumers and with a limited number
of messages can be used to pre-populate a queue, e.g. with
1M messages 1 kB in size each::

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest -y0 -p -u "throughput-test-14" \
   -s 1000 -C 1000000 --id "test-14" -f persistent

Use the `-D` option to limit the number of consumed messages. Note
the `-z` (time limit), `-C` (number of
published messages), and `-D` (number of consumed messages)
options can be used together but their combination can lead to funny results.
`-r 1 -x 1 -C 10 -y 1 -D 20` would for example stop the producer
once 10 messages have been published, letting the consumer wait forever
the remaining 10 messages (as the publisher is stopped).

To consume from a pre-declared and pre-populated queue without starting any publishers,
use

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest -x0 -y10 -p -u "throughput-test-14" --id "test-15"

PerfTest is useful for establishing baseline cluster throughput with
various configurations but does not simulate many other aspects of
real world applications. It is also biased towards very simplistic
workloads that use a single queue, which provides https://www.rabbitmq.com/queues.html[limited CPU utilisation]
on RabbitMQ nodes and is not recommended for most cases.

Multiple PerfTest instances running simultaneously can be used to
simulate more realistic workloads.

== How It Works

If a queue name is defined (`-u "queue-name"`),
PerfTest will create a queue with this name and all
consumers will consume from this queue. The queue will be
bound to the direct exchange with its name as the routing
key. The routing key will be used by producers to send
messages.  This will cause messages from all producers to be
sent to this single queue and all consumers to receive
messages from this single queue.

If the queue name is not defined, PerfTest will create a
random UUID routing key with which producers will publish
messages.  Each consumer will create its own anonymous queue
and bind it to the direct exchange with this routing key.
This will cause each message from all producers to be
replicated to multiple queues (number of queues equals
number of consumers), while each consumer will be receiving
messages from only one queue.

Note it is possible to link:#customising-queues-and-messages[customise]
the queue and to work against link:#working-with-many-queues[several queues] as well.

== Stopping PerfTest

There are 2 reasons for a PerfTest run to stop:

 * one of the limits has been reached (time limit, producer or consumer message count)
 * the process is stopped by the user, e.g. by using Ctrl-C in the terminal

In both cases, PerfTest tries to exit as cleanly as possible, in a reasonable amount of time.
Nevertheless, when PerfTest AMQP connections are throttled by the broker, because they're
publishing too fast or because broker https://www.rabbitmq.com/alarms.html[alarms]
have kicked in, it can take time to close them (several seconds or more for one connection).

If closing connections in the gentle way takes too long (5 seconds by default), PerfTest
will move on to the most important resources to free and terminates. This can result
in `client unexpectedly closed TCP connection` messages in the broker logs. Note this
means the AMQP connection hasn't been closed with the right sequence of AMQP frames,
but the socket has been closed properly. There's no resource leakage here.

The connection closing timeout can be set up with the `--shutdown-timeout` argument (or `-st`).
The default timeout can be increased to let more time to close connections, e.g. the
command below uses a shutdown timeout of 20 seconds:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest --shutdown-timeout 20

The connection closing sequence can also be skipped by setting the timeout to 0 or any negative
value:

 bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest --shutdown-timeout -1

With the previous command, PerfTest won't even try to close AMQP connections, it will exit
as fast as possible, freeing only the most important resources. This is perfectly
acceptable when performing runs on a test environment.
