PerfTest is a throughput testing tool for https://www.rabbitmq.com/[RabbitMQ]

== Introduction

https://www.rabbitmq.com/[RabbitMQ] has a throughput testing tool,
PerfTest, that is based on
the Java client and can be configured to simulate basic
workloads and link:#workloads-with-a-large-number-of-clients[more advanced workloads] as well.
PerfTest has extra tools that produce HTML graphs of the output.

A RabbitMQ cluster can be limited by a number of factors,
from infrastructure-level constraints (e.g. network bandwidth) to
RabbitMQ configuration and topology to applications that publish
and consume. PerfTest can demonstrate baseline performance of a
node or a cluster of nodes.
